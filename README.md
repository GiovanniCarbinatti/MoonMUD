# Welcome to MoonMUD!

## A simple (for now) MUD-like game written in Lua Language.

Data is stored in a local sqlite mud.db file.
It can be played locally. Execute the main.lua and connects via telnet with the command
- telnet localhost 12345

The 'multiuser' part of the MUD needs to be implemented

There's a lot a things to do in the game mechanics, although one of most boring parts (create user and auth) is already implemented (must be revisited and migrated to a new file though).
The password system must be revisited to grant security when online (not the case now)

Contributions are very welcome!
